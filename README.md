# *The Emergency-Driven Development (EDD) Manifesto*  

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by constantly putting out fires and thriving in chaos. Through this work, we have come to value:  

- **Crisis management** over careful planning  
- **Last-minute patches** over sustainable architecture  
- **Urgent hacks** over well-thought-out design  
- **Blame assignment** over root cause analysis  

That is, while we acknowledge that stability, planning, and maintainability have some value, *we prioritize immediate disaster mitigation at all costs.*  

### *EDD Principles*  

1. *Our highest priority is to deploy fixes immediately*â€”whether they work or not is a problem for Future Us.  
2. *Changing requirements are not just welcomeâ€”they are inevitable, because we didnâ€™t anticipate them in the first place.*  
3. *Delivering hotfixes frequently* is the primary measure of progress.  
4. *Developers and managers must work together daily*, mostly in frantic all-hands calls.  
5. *Projects are built around exhausted, overworked individuals* who are expected to sustain an indefinite firefighting pace.  
6. *The most efficient form of communication is panicked Slack messages at 3 AM.*  
7. *Working software is the primary measure of successâ€”until the next outage.*  
8. *Sustainable development is a nice theory, but we prefer the thrill of continuous survival mode.*  
9. *Technical excellence and good design enhance agility, but we wouldnâ€™t knowâ€”we never have time for either.*  
10. *Simplicityâ€”the art of maximizing the amount of work undoneâ€”is irrelevant when everything is on fire.*  
11. *The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from years of accumulated, hastily applied patches.*  
12. *At regular intervals, the team should reflect on how to improve their processâ€”but only after the current crisis is resolved (which is never).*  

Welcome to EDD, where every day is a new emergency, and nothing is ever really "done"! ðŸš¨ðŸ”¥
